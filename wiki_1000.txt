<page> <title>abstract_illusionism</title><text>\'\'\'abstract illusionism\'\'\', a name coined by art historian and critic [[barbara rose]],<ref>[http://www.charlottejackson.com/archives/abstract%20illusionism%20barbara%20rose%201967%20artforum.pdf barbara rose. \"abstract illusionism.\"] artforum, october 1967, pp. 33-37.</ref> is an artistic movement that came into prominence in the [[united states]] during the mid-1970s. works consisted of both [[hard-edge]] and [[abstract expressionism|expressionistic]] abstract painting styles that employed the use of perspective, artificial light sources, and simulated cast shadows to achieve the illusion of three-dimensional space on a two-dimensional surface. abstract illusionism differed from traditional [[trompe-l\'œil]] (fool the eye) art in that the pictorial space seemed to project in front of, or away from, the canvas surface, as opposed to receding into the picture plane as in traditional painting. primarily, though, these were abstract paintings, as opposed to the realism of trompe l\'oeil. by the early 1980s, many of the visual devices that originated in abstract illusionism were appropriated into the commercial world and served a wide variety of applications in graphic design, fabric design and the unlikely decoration of recreational vehicles. this proliferation of abstract illusionist imagery eventually led to the disintegration of the original artistic movement and its transition into the mainstream.\n\npre-1970 forerunners and practitioners of the style include [[ronald davis]], [[allan d\'arcangelo]], and [[al held]]. documented artists associated with the 1970s abstract illusionism movement include [[james havard]], [[jack lembeck]], tony king, [[george d. green]], [[michael b. gallagher]], [[jack reilly (artist)|jack reilly]] and richard johnson.\n\nthe first major museum exhibitions to survey abstract illusionism were \"abstract illusionism,\" paul mellon arts center, wallingford, ct, 1977; \"seven new yor
<page> <title>abstract_polytope</title><text>[[image:isomorphic tetragons.svg|thumb|275px|as abstract polytopes, these quadrilaterals are all the same.]]\nin [[mathematics]], an \'\'\'abstract polytope\'\'\', informally speaking, is a structure which considers only the \'\'[[combinatorics|combinatorial]]\'\' properties of a traditional [[polytope]], ignoring many of its other properties, such as angles, edge lengths, etc. no space, such as [[euclidean space]], is required to contain it.\n\nthe term \'\'polytope\'\' is a generalisation of [[polygon]]s and [[polyhedron|polyhedra]] into any number of dimensions. \n\nwe shall present a precise, formal definition of an abstract polytope [[abstract polytope#formal definition|below]]. in fact, this definition is \'\'more general\'\' than the traditional concept of a polytope, and allows many new objects that have no counterpart in traditional theory.\n\n== traditional versus abstract polytopes ==\n\nin euclidean geometry, the six [[quadrilateral]]s above are all different.  yet they have something in common that is not shared by a triangle or a cube, for example.\n\nthe elegant, but geographically inaccurate, [[tube map|london tube map]] provides all the \'\'relevant\'\' information to go from \'\'a\'\' to \'\'b\'\'. an even better example is an electrical [[circuit diagram]] or schematic; the final layout of wires and parts is often unrecognisable at first glance. \n\nin each of these examples, the \'\'connections\'\' between elements are the same, regardless of the \'\'physical layout\'\'. the objects are said to be \'\'combinatorially equivalent\'\'. this equivalence is what is encapsulated in the concept of an abstract polytope. so, combinatorially, our six quadrilaterals are all the “same”. more rigorously, they are said to be [[isomorphic]] or “structure preserving”. \n\nproperties, particularly measurable ones, of traditional polytopes such as angles, edge-lengths, skewness, and convexity \'\'have no meaning
<page> <title>abstraction_model_checking</title><text>{{context|date=october 2009}}\n\'\'\'abstraction model checking\'\'\' is for systems where an actual representation is too complex in developing the model alone. so, the design undergoes a kind of translation to scaled down \"abstract\" version.\n\nthe set of [[variable (mathematics)|variables]] are partitioned into visible and invisible depending on their change of values. the real [[state space]] is summarized into a smaller set of the visible ones.\n\n==galois connected==\nthe real and the abstract state spaces are [[galois connection|galois connected]]. this means that if we take an element from the [[abstract space]], concretize it and abstract the concretized version, the result will be equal to the original. on the other hand, if you pick an element from the real space, abstract it and concretize the abstract version, the final result will be a super set of the original.\n\nthat is, \n\n<math>\\\\eta</math>(<math>\\\\theta</math>(abstract)) = abstract  <br/>\n<math>\\\\theta</math>(<math>\\\\eta</math>(real))  <math>\\\\supset</math> real\n\n==abstraction refinement loop==\na problem with abstraction [[model checking]] is that although the abstraction simulates the real, when the abstraction does not satisfy a property, it does not mean that this property actually fails in the real model. counter examples are checked against the real state space because we obtain \"spurious\" counter examples. so a part of the abstraction refinement loop is:\n#obtain the abstract model \n#model check and see if everything is ok. \n#if there is a counter example, then go back to the real state space and find out if it actually a counter model. \n#if not, return and continue model checking. \n\nspurious examples are mostly generated because dead end states and bad states are abstracted to the same kind. to solve this we need to create a segregation between the 2 kinds. the next step is to find the subset of invisible variabl

<page> <title>acousmatic_music</title><text>\'\'\'acousmatic music\'\'\' is a form of [[electroacoustic music]] that is specifically composed for presentation using [[loudspeaker|speakers]], as opposed to a live performance. it stems from a compositional tradition that dates back to the introduction of [[musique concrète]] (a form of experimental music) in the late 1940s. unlike musical works that are realised using [[sheet music]] exclusively, [[musical composition|compositions]] that are purely acousmatic exist solely as [[audio format|audio recordings]] on media such as discs or tapes.{{citation needed|date=june 2013}}<!--does this mean, then, that stockhausen\'s \'\'studie ii\'\' and \'\'telemusik\'\', as well as ligeti\'s artikilation, all of which have been published as scores printed on paper, are not acousmatic music? does an acousmatic composition suddenly become non-acousmatic when a score is published of it? most importantly, who says so?-->\n\nthe compositional practice of acousmatic music features [[acousmatic sound]] as a central [[musical aspect]]. other aspects traditionally thought of as \'musical\' such as [[melody]], [[harmony]], [[rhythm]], [[meter (music)|metre]] may be present but more often consideration is given to sound-based characteristics such as [[timbre]] and [[spectral music|spectrum]]. compositional materials can include sounds derived from [[musical instruments]], [[voice]], electronically generated sound, audio that has been manipulated using various [[effects units|effect processors]], as well as general [[sound effects]] and [[field recordings]].\n\nthe music is produced with the aid of various [[music technology|music technologies]], such as [[digital recording|digital recorders]], [[digital signal processing]] tools and [[digital audio workstation]]s. using such technology various sound materials can be combined, juxtaposed, and transformed in any conceivable manner. in this context the compositional method can be seen as a pro

[[artillery]] fire is abstract.  air and naval power are not simulated.  units begin the game at set locations and both sides later receive reinforcements.  night game-turns (turns one, four, and seven) slow movement and disallow artillery use.  both sides may achieve combined arms effects, which result in a column shift on the crt, for a specific attack by attacking with [[armoured forces|armor]] units and [[infantry]] or [[mechanized infantry]].\n\nthe israeli side achieves victory if at the end of the seventh turn the player has installed a bridge over the suez canal, has crossed at least six israeli units over the canal, and maintains a clear line of communication (loc) back to the israeli starting point.  if not, the egyptian player

[[acta senatus]] were originally kept secret, until then-[[consul]] [[julius caesar]] made them public in 59 bc. later rulers, however, often [[censorship|censored]] them.\n\npublication of the \'\'acta diurna\'\' stopped when the seat of the emperor was moved to [[constantinople]].\n\nthe \'\'acta diurna\'\' to some extent filled the place of the modern [[newspaper]] and of the government [[gazette]].  today, there are many [[academic journal|academic periodical]]s with the word \'\'acta\'\' in their titles (the publisher [[elsevier]] has 64 such titles).\n\nacta diurna introduced the expression “publicare et propagare”, which means \"make public and propagate.\" this expression was set in the end of the texts and proclaimed a release to both roman citizens an

<page> <title>active_citizenship</title><text>{{for|the left-wing political coalition in san marino|active citizenship (political coalition)}}\n\n\'\'\'active citizenship\'\'\' refers to a [[philosophy]] espoused by organizations and educational institutions which advocates that members of companies or [[nation-state]]s have certain roles and responsibilities to [[society]] and the [[natural environment|environment]], although those members may not have specific governing roles.\n\nactive citizenship can be seen as an articulation of the debate over [[rights]] versus [[moral responsibility|responsibilities]]. if a body gives rights to the people under its remit, then those same people might have certain responsibilities to uphold. this would be most obvious at a [[country]] or nation-state level, but could also be wider, such as [[global citizenship]]. the implication is that an active citizen is one who fulfills both their rights and responsibilities in a balanced way.\n\na problem with this concept is that although rights are often written down as part of law, responsibilities are not as well defined, and there may be disagreements amongst the citizens as to what the responsibilities are. for example, in the [[uk|united kingdom]], citizens have the right to free health care, but [[voting]] in [[elections]] is not compulsory, even though many people would define this as a responsibility.\n\nwriting a clear definition of responsibilities for an active citizen is much more problematic than writing a list of rights. for example, although voting might be considered a basic responsibility by many people, there are some who through [[disability]] or other issues are not able to [[participation (decision making)|participate]] fully in the voting process.\n\nan active citizen is someone who takes a role in the community. the term has been identified with volunteering by writers such as jonathan tisch, who wrote in the \'\'[[huffington post]]\'\' in 2010 advocating that bus

[[network processor]]s are one means of implementing active networking concepts. active networks have also been implemented as [[overlay network]]s.\n\n== what does it offer? ==\n\nactive networking allows the possibility of highly tailored and rapid \"real-time\" changes to the underlying network operation.\nthis enables such ideas as sending code along with packets of information allowing the data to change its form (code) to match the channel characteristics.\nthe smallest program that can generate a sequence of data can be found in the definition of [[kolmogorov complexity]].\nthe use of real-time [[genetic algorithm|genetic algorithms]] within the network to compose network services is also enabled by active networking.\n\n== fundamental challenges ==\n\nactive network research addresses the nature of how best to incorporate extremely dynamic capability within networks.<ref>bush, s. f., a simple metric for ad hoc network adaptation ieee journal on selected areas in communications journal, 2005, 23, 2272–2287 [http://www.research.ge.com/~bushsf/pdfpapers/01546098.pdf]</ref>\n\nin order to do this, active network research must address the problem of optima
<page> <title>active_safety</title><text>{{refimprove|date=may 2009}}\n\nthe term \'\'\'active safety\'\'\' can be used in two distinct ways. \n\nthe first, mainly used in the us, refers to safety systems that help avoid accidents, such as good steering and brakes. in this context, passive safety refers to features that help reduce the effects of an accident, such as seat belts, airbags and strong body structures. this use is essentially interchangeable with the terms primary and secondary safety that tend to be used in the uk.\n\nhowever, active safety is increasingly being used to describe systems that use an understanding of the state of the vehicle to both avoid and minimise the effects of a crash. these include braking systems, like [[brake assist]], [[traction control system]]s and electronic stability control systems, that interpret signals from various sensors to help the driver control the vehicle.\nadditionally, forward-looking, sensor-based systems such as [[advanced driver assistance systems]] including [[adaptive cruise control]] and collision warning/avoidance/mitigation systems are also considered as active safety systems under this definition.\n\nthese forward-looking technologies are expected to play an increasing role in collision avoidance and mitigation in the future. most major component suppliers, such as delphi, trw and bosch, are developing such systems. however, as they become more sophisticated, questions will need to be addressed regarding driver autonomy and at what point these systems should intervene if they believe a crash is likely.\n\nin [[engineering]], \'\'\'active safety\'\'\' systems are systems activated in response to a safety problem or abnormal event. such systems may be activated by a human operator, automatically by a [[computer]] driven system, or even mechanically. in [[nuclear engineering]], active safety contrasts to [[passively safe|passive safety]] in that it relies on operator or computer automated intervention, wher

<page> <title>adaptive_coding</title><text>{{unreferenced|date=june 2009|bot=yes}}\n\'\'\'adaptive coding\'\'\' refers to variants of [[entropy encoding]] methods of [[lossless data compression]]. they are particularly suited to streaming data, as they adapt to localized changes in the characteristics of the data, and don\'t require a first pass over the data to calculate a probability model. the cost paid for these advantages is that the encoder and decoder must be more complex to keep their states synchronized, and more computational power is needed to keep adapting the encoder/decoder state.\n\nalmost all [[data compression]] methods involve the use of a \'\'model\'\', a prediction of the composition of the data.  when the data matches the prediction made by the model, the encoder can usually transmit the content of the data at a lower information cost, by making reference to the model.\nthis general statement is a bit misleading as general data compression algorithm would include the popular [[lzw]] and [[lz77]] algorithms,\nwhich are hardly comparable to compression techniques typically called \'\'adaptive\'\'.\n[[run length encoding]] and the typical [[jpeg]] compression with run length encoding and predefined huffman codes do not transmit a model.\na lot of other methods adapt their model to the current file and need to transmit it in addition to the encoded data, because both the encoder and the decoder need to use the model.\n\nin adaptive coding, the encoder and decoder are instead equipped with a predefined meta-model about how they will alter their models in response to the actual content of the data, and otherwise start with a blank slate, meaning that no initial model needs to be transmitted.  as the data is transmitted, both encoder and decoder adapt their models, so that unless the character of the data changes radically, the model becomes better-adapted to the data its handling and compresses it more efficiently approaching the efficiency of the sta

<page> <title>added_worker_effect</title><text>{{orphan|date=march 2011}}\n\nthe \'\'\'added worker effect\'\'\' refers to an increase in the [[labor supply]] of married women when their husbands become unemployed. underlying the theory is the assumption that married women are secondary workers with a less permanent attachment to the labor market than their partners. as statistics show, married women do not always behave as secondary workers; therefore, the effect is not a universal phenomenon.\n[[file:awe model.png|thumb|simple model of the added worker effect after shelly lundberg\'s (1985)]]\n\n== origin of idea ==\n\nthe concept of “additional workers” first appears in empiric studies on unemployment in the united states during the great depression conducted in 1940 by economists [[wladimir s. woytinsky]] and don d. humphrey (humphrey, 1940, p.&nbsp;412). humphrey\'s study did not find any observable added worker effect, but it did not deny that added workers participated in the market (humphrey, p.&nbsp;415). he challenged the validity of woytinsky\'s study in the absence of a [[time series analysis]].\n\n== relation to income and substitution effects ==\n\nthe added worker effect results when the income effect dominates the substitution effect in an individual\'s decision whether or not to participate in the labor market. specifically, in the added worker effect married women increase their labor supplied as a response to a loss of [[real income]] despite the price of leisure dropping in relation to the wage rate. the income and substitution effects are important concepts in the [[consumer choice theory]] of microeconomics. \n\nthe model used to study the added worker effect views the family as a decision making unit and leisure time as a [[normal good]]. with this understanding, a married woman may chose to enter the labor market to offset the loss of income her family faces when her husband loses his job. since family wages are pooled and the price of co

<page> <title>agema</title><text>{{unreferenced|date=august 2013}}\n\'\'\'agema\'\'\' ({{lang-el|Άγημα}}), is a term to describe a military detachment, used for a special cause, such as guarding high valued targets. due to its nature the \'\'agema\'\' is most probably composed by elite troops. \n\n== etymology ==\nthe word derives from the greek verb \'\'ago\'\' ({{lang-el|\'\'Άγω\'\'}}; to route/to drive). it can literally mean a \'\'pack\'\', a \'\'routing\'\' party and/or a detachment that has a single commander.\n\n== macedonian army ==\nin ancient [[macedon]]ia, they were [[hypaspist]]s and [[asthetairoi]], and later [[argyraspids]] (silver shields). in the eastern [[diadochi]] states (the [[seleucid empire]], [[ptolemaic dynasty|ptolemaic]] egypt, the kingdom of [[bactria]]) they were the infantry guards of the king. the eastern agema guards wore bronze plate, [[phrygia]]n (or [[thrace|thracian]]) helmet and [[argos|argive]] shield, and carried [[sarissa]] and short sword.\n\n=== the agema in the antigonid army ===\nin macedon, especially under [[philip v of macedon]] and [[perseus of macedon]], the agema formed an elite body within the corps of \'[[peltasts]]\'. this corps is not to be confused with the light infantry. the macedonian peltast corps was the equivalent of the [[hypaspists]] in alexander the great\'s army. the agema, as well as the peltasts, according to duncan head, would fight in pitched battle as a conventional phalanx. yet they may have used lighter equipment for forced marches.\n\n=== the agema in the seleucid army ===\nthe agema had a full name, ‘the agema of the hypaspists’. the fact that there is an absence of them in detailed writings about the seleucid campaigns may be due that they only retained the second half of their name and were the hypaspists. they formed a crack force within the infantry guardsmen corps.\n\nthe agema in the [[seleucid]] army was also elite corps of cavalry that would escort the king into battle or be
